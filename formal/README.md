# UCNS Formal — Lean 4 scaffold for Theorem N

This directory is a **Lean 4 scaffold** for machine-checking the UCNS
completeness results, principally the Theorem N family described in
[`../ucns-theorem-n.md`](../ucns-theorem-n.md).

## Status: FRONTIER / awaiting external formal review

This is exploratory scaffolding. **The theorem statements here are stubbed
with `sorry` and prove nothing yet.** Lean will accept the file (a `sorry`
closes any goal) but each `sorry` is an unverified hole — no proof obligation
has been discharged. The statements themselves may also be imprecise
transcriptions of the informal claims and are subject to revision during
formal review.

The informal, prose-level argument for Theorem N (and its instances Lemma 7
and the depth-3 results) lives in [`../ucns-theorem-n.md`](../ucns-theorem-n.md).
That document is the source of truth for the *claims*; this directory is an
attempt to restate those claims in a form a proof assistant could eventually
check.

## Proof-status non-transfer discipline

**A `sorry`-backed statement confers no `DEFENDED` status to any consumer
repository.** Concretely:

- A `theorem ... := sorry` in this directory is *not* a proof. It is a
  placeholder for a proof that does not yet exist.
- No downstream repository, package, or claim may cite this scaffold as
  evidence that any UCNS result is formally verified.
- A result graduates from FRONTIER only when every `sorry` in its statement
  (and its transitive dependencies) has been removed and replaced by a
  complete, type-checked proof term, and that has been confirmed by external
  formal review.

Until then, treat everything here as a specification draft, not a guarantee.

## Layout

- `lean-toolchain` — pins the Lean 4 toolchain version.
- `lakefile.lean` — minimal Lake package definition (`Ucns`).
- `Ucns/TheoremN.lean` — stub statements (all `sorry`) for:
  - depth-1 restricted completeness,
  - the depth-2 oracle result (Lemma 7),
  - catalogue-sufficient completeness (Theorem N).

## Building (once Lean is installed)

```sh
# from this directory, with elan/lake installed
lake build
```

A successful `lake build` here means only that the *statements* type-check
with their `sorry` placeholders — it does **not** mean the theorems are proven.
