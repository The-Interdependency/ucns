# UCNS v0.8 — Lemma 8: Depth-3 Factor Search

> **SUPERSEDED BY `ucns-theorem-n.md`.**
> Theorem 8c (§4) is vacuously true: multiplicative-D'' = ∅ because
> `multiply(D'_oracle, D'_oracle)` produces depth-≤2 output (symmetric
> multiplication preserves depth). The depth-3 cases of interest are
> asymmetric and are covered by Theorem N / Theorem 9. See §6.1 of
> `ucns-theorem-n.md` for the retraction. Theorems 8a and 8b are
> unaffected. This document is preserved as an audit trail.

**Status:** All three theorems proven. Depth-3 completeness holds
unconditionally after the loop-order fix in `factor_search_v08`
(see §1.6). Theorem 8c now known vacuous (see header above).
**Scope:** `factor_search_v08` applied to depth-3 objects, using the
depth-1 oracle catalogue as payload basis.
**Depends on:** Lemma 7 (depth-2 oracle theorem), E10.4 cancellativity,
v0.6 left-quotient completeness, recursive multiply structural definition.
**Supersedes:** prior drafts with three issues fixed:
(1) coverage definition treated catalogue as factor-pair set (§1.3).
(2) Conjecture 8c specified wrong catalogue (depth-2 instead of depth-1) (§1.3).
(3) algorithm loop `range(2,n)` excluded non-unit 1-cell factors; ordering
fix prevents the face-flip fallback from preempting intended p≥2 paths (§1.6).

## hmm

This document is split into three theorems plus the reframed coverage
condition. The split exists because the prior single-statement Lemma 8
draft conflated three independent facts:

- **Closure** of multiplicative-D'' inside the depth-3 oracle class.
- **Soundness** of `factor_search_v08` on depth-3 inputs.
- **Completeness** of `factor_search_v08` on multiplicative-D''.

All three discharge. Theorem 8c's discharge is vacuous (see header).

## §1 — Reframed setup

### §1.1 Domains

Let `D'` denote the frozen depth-2 domain (depth ≤ 2, |A⁺| ≤ 3, n_min ≤ 4),
with the oracle-class predicate `is_in_oracle_class` from `domains.py`.

Let `D'_oracle ⊆ D'` denote the depth-2 oracle class (objects that
`is_in_oracle_class` accepts: depth ≤ 2 with all payloads being depth ≤ 1
oracle atoms, plus the unit).

Define two depth-3 domains:

- **Constructive D''** (the output of `build_catalogue_d3_oracle`):
  the set of objects of depth exactly 3, every payload in `D'_oracle`,
  every angle/face combination accepted by the canonical constructor.

- **Multiplicative D''** (the algorithmic-reach target of Theorem 8c):
  the set `{ multiply(A, B) : A, B ∈ D'_oracle, multiply(A, B) defined,
  depth(multiply(A, B)) = 3 }`.

  **Note:** This set is empty. Symmetric multiplication preserves depth;
  `D'_oracle × D'_oracle` produces depth-≤2. See `ucns-theorem-n.md §6.1`.

### §1.2 What "catalogue" means in `factor_search_v08`

The `catalogue` parameter is passed to `solve_payload_system` and used
as the candidate set for `S_A` and `S_B` — the **payload sequences** of
the reconstructed factors. The catalogue is not a set of factor pairs.

### §1.3 Coverage condition (corrected) and catalogue

**Definition (catalogue covers a target domain).** A catalogue `C`
**covers** `T` iff for every `P ∈ T`, there exist `A`, `B` such that:

1. `multiply(A, B) ≡_seq P`,
2. every payload of `A` and every payload of `B` lies in `C`,
3. the angle and face structures of `A` and `B` are consistent with
   the host-recovery and face-recovery procedures.

Lemma 7 at depth-2 and Theorem 8c at depth-3 both use
C = `generate_payload_catalogue()` (depth-1 oracle atoms, including
`None`). The catalogue is always one level below the factors' payload
depth: for depth-2-oracle factors, payloads are depth-1 atoms.

### §1.4 Multiply structural recursion (confirmed)

`canonical.py:189` (`new_payload = multiply(S_k_A, S_j_B)`) is
genuinely recursive with no depth-conditional branches.

### §1.5 Algorithm depth-agnosticism (W2 + W3)

`find_right_factor_or_sentinel` in `recursive_quotient.py` is a pure
catalogue scan using `multiply` and `==`. No depth branch. The witness
matrix checks use only `==` on canonical objects. Both W2 and W3
discharge unconditionally.

### §1.6 Loop order and range fix (premise error corrected)

The prior algorithm had `for p in range(2, n)`. This excluded `p = 1`,
making factorizations where the left factor has exactly 1 cell unreachable.

`is_unit` in `canonical.py` returns True only for the specific 1-cell
object with `angle=0, payload=None, face=[0], n_min=1`. Non-unit 1-cell
objects (e.g. `face=[1]` or `payload≠None`) are valid D'_oracle members
whose factorizations were silently missed. Concretely: for `|P|=2`, the
loop `range(2,2)` is empty and the algorithm returns SEQ-PRIME for every
2-cell P regardless of content — a completeness violation.

`host_recovery.recover_host_angles(P, 1, n)` and
`recover_face_structures(P, 1, n)` both work correctly for `p=1`
(verified by reading the arithmetic: A_angles = [0], B_angles =
P's full angle sequence; face assignment is consistent).

**Critical ordering requirement.** For `p=1` with `S_A=[None]`,
`solve_payload_system` always succeeds (returns `S_B = P`'s payload
row). The face-flip non-unit (`face=[1]`, normalizes to `n_min=1`)
passes `is_unit()` (returns False) and satisfies
`multiply(A_flip, B_flip) == P`. If `p=1` were tried first, it would
preempt the intended `p≥2` factorisation for objects with `|A|≥2`,
returning a `|P|`-cell B outside D' (violating `|A⁺| ≤ 3` for
large products).

**Fix:** the loop is now:
```python
for p in (list(range(2, n)) + ([1] if n >= 2 else [])):
```
Balanced factorisations (`p ≥ 2`) are tried first; `p=1` is the explicit
fallback. For `n=1`: loop is empty → SEQ-PRIME (length-1 is seq-prime).
For `n=2`: `range(2,2)=[]` → only `p=1` is tried. For `n≥4`: the
intended `p≥2` factorisation is found before `p=1` is reached.

**Mathematical corollary.** Every length-≥2 UCNSObject is seq-composite
via the 1-cell face-flip factorisation. Only length-1 objects are seq-prime.

## §2 — Theorem 8a: Closure

**Theorem 8a (Multiplicative-D'' ⊆ Constructive-D'').** If `A, B ∈
D'_oracle` and `multiply(A, B)` is defined and has depth 3, then
`multiply(A, B)` lies in constructive-D''.

**Proof.** Each payload of `P = multiply(A, B)` at cell `(k, j)` is
`multiply(A.payload[k], B.payload[j])`. Since `A, B ∈ D'_oracle`, both
payloads are depth-1 oracle atoms. By Lemma 7 oracle closure,
`multiply(depth-1-atom, depth-1-atom) ∈ D'_oracle`. So every payload of
`P` lies in `D'_oracle`. Combined with `depth(P) = 3` (given) and the
canonical well-formedness of `multiply`'s output, `P ∈` constructive-D''. ∎

*(Note: the antecedent "has depth 3" is never satisfied for A, B ∈ D'_oracle.
Theorem 8a is vacuously true for the same reason as Theorem 8c.)*

---

## §3 — Theorem 8b: Soundness

**Theorem 8b (Soundness).** For any catalogue `C` and any input `P`,
if `factor_search_v08(P, C)` returns `(A, B)`, then `multiply(A, B) = P`.

**Proof.** Step 5 is the literal check `multiply(A_cand, B_cand) == P`.
The function returns only when this holds. ∎

*(Theorem 8b is unconditional and not affected by the vacuity of Theorem 8c.)*

---

## §4 — Theorem 8c: Completeness on multiplicative-D''

**Theorem 8c (Completeness).** Let `C = generate_payload_catalogue()`.
For every `P ∈ multiplicative-D''`, `factor_search_v08(P, C)` returns
`(A, B)` with `multiply(A, B) = P`.

**Proof.** Let `P = A ⨠ B` where `A, B ∈ D'_oracle`, `p = |A.A_plus|`,
`q = |B.A_plus|`, `n = pq`.

**Step 1.** The loop `list(range(2,n)) + [1]` reaches `p`. If `p ≥ 2`,
`p` is in `range(2,n)` (since `p < n` because `q ≥ 1`). If `p = 1`,
`p` is the explicit final element. In both cases `p` is reached before
the SEQ-PRIME return. Non-triviality of both factors is enforced by
`is_unit` at step 5, not by the loop bound. Host recovery extracts
`A.angles`, `B.angles` exactly (W1, structural, depth-agnostic). ✓

**Step 2.** `P_payloads[k][j] = multiply(A.payload[k], B.payload[j])`.
When `solve_payload_system` tries `S0_A = A.payload[0] ∈ C`:
- Row 0: `find_right_factor_or_sentinel` scans `C` for `R` with
  `multiply(A.payload[0], R) = multiply(A.payload[0], B.payload[j])`.
  E10.4 gives `R = B.payload[j] ∈ C` uniquely. ✓
- Column 0, k > 0: symmetric, recovers `S_A[k] = A.payload[k] ∈ C`. ✓
- Global consistency: holds by construction of `P`. ✓

**Step 3.** Witness matrix: all cells verified, row/column consistent.
`globally_consistent()` = True (depth-agnostic `==` checks). ✓

**Step 4.** `recover_face_structures` returns correct `A.faces`, `B.faces`. ✓

**Step 5.** `A_cand = A`, `B_cand = B`. `is_unit(A)` and `is_unit(B)`
are both False (A, B ∈ D'_oracle are non-unit by hypothesis).
`multiply(A, B) = P`. Returns `(A, B)`. ∎

*(This proof discharges over an empty domain. Multiplicative-D'' = ∅ because
`multiply(D'_oracle, D'_oracle)` produces depth-≤2, never depth-3. The proof
steps are all correct; the domain assumption in the theorem statement is vacuous.
See `ucns-theorem-n.md §6.1`.)*
