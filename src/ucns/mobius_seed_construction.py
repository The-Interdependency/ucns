"""Construction state for the seven-band Mobius Seed of Life.

This is the smallest UCNS construction authority: a set of built band slots
plus a buildable-next rule derived only from the seed's own structural-vesica
relations. A consumer (for example AHBG) binds its build mechanic to this state
instead of inventing construction geometry.

Usage guidance:
    Start with ``initial_construction_state()`` and advance only through
    ``construct()``. Persist ``state.as_dict()["built"]`` and recover it with
    ``from_built()``; serialized slot strings are validated and round-trip.
