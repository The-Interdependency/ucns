"""
UCNS factorization attack harness for PCEA-UCNS domain design.

This module exists to MEASURE, not to assert. It points the real UCNS
factorization tools (factor_search_v08 and the Carrier-LCM-Law pruning
corollaries) at candidate cryptographic domains and reports what they
recover. The forbidden-domain list in ucns-crypto-domain-v0.md is
derived from these measurements, not from argument.

Run as an attack tool, not a security proof: a domain that survives
this harness is NOT thereby secure; a domain that falls IS thereby
forbidden. Absence of recovery here is necessary, never sufficient.

Dependency note: this is a TEST/DESIGN tool. It imports ucns (an
Interdependency repo, allowed per the dependency covenant) but lives
outside the PCEA runtime modules (see contract.RUNTIME_MODULES) and is
never imported by the cipher. It is skipped if ucns is not installed.
