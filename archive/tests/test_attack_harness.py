Tests for the UCNS attack harness.

These are not security proofs. They pin the MEASURED behavior that the
domain spec relies on, so that a change in UCNS (or in this harness)
which alters the forbidden-domain conclusions fails loudly.

Skipped entirely when ucns is not installed, keeping PCEA's core suite
dependency-free.
